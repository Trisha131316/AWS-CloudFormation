Problem Statement:
You work for XYZ Corporation. Your corporation wants to launch a new
web-based application. The development team has prepared the code but it is
not tested yet. The development team needs the system admins to build a web
server to test the code but the system admins are not available.
Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Web tier: Launch an instance in a public subnet and that instance should
allow HTTP and SSH from the internet.
2. Application tier: Launch an instance in a private subnet of the web tier and
it should allow only SSH from the public subnet of Web Tier-3.
3. DB tier: Launch an RDS MYSQL instance in a private subnet and it should
allow connection on port 3306 only from the private subnet of Application
Tier-4.
4. Setup a Route 53 hosted zone and direct traffic to the EC2 instance.
You have been also asked to propose a solution so that:
1. Development team can test their code without having to involve the system
admins and can invest their time in testing the code rather than
provisioning, configuring and updating the resources needed to test the
code.
2. Make sure when the development team deletes the stack, RDS DB
instances should not be deleted.
